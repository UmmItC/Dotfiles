# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions of all kinds, from bug reports to new features. To ensure a smooth process, please review these guidelines.

## Reporting Issues

- **Search first:** Before creating a new issue, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- **Use the templates:** Select either the "Bug Report" or "Feature Request" template and fill out the required information. This helps us understand the problem and a potential solution faster.

## Submitting Pull Requests

1.  **Explain your changes:** Clearly describe what you've done and why.
2.  **Use Conventional Commits:** Your commit messages have to follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This helps us to understand the history of changes.
    - **Good:** `fix(battery-display): disable test mode in battery display script`
    - **Bad:** `update script`
