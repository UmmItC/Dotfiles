For installation instructions and other information, I recently created my own documentation page. Please take a look at this website: [UmmIt Docs](https://docs.withkin.me/docs/ummitos-main).

**Therefore, all the information about UmmItOS will be moved to this webpage!**

## Star me!

If you like my dotfiles, please leave a star!

It motivates me to keep maintaining the repo. i need to maintain it since I use it every day xd, but I would be really happy if you leave a star for me. Thank you!
